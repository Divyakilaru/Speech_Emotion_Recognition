# Speech_Emotion_Recognition
Speech emotion recognition (SER) is the field of technology focused on identifying the emotional state of
a speaker from their voice. This goes beyond the words spoken and analyzes how they are spoken.

The idea behind creating this project was to build a machine-learning model that could detect emotions
from the speech we have with each other all the time. Nowadays personalization is something that is
needed in all the things we experience every day.

So why not have an emotion detector that will gauge your emotions and in the future recommend you
different things based on your mood This can be used by multiple industries to offer different services like
marketing companies suggesting you buy products based on your emotions, the automotive industry
can detect the person emotions and adjust the speed of autonomous cars as required to avoid any
collisions etc
